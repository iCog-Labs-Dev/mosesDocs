# Types, Structures and Classes

This section briefly reviews the key data types, data structures and classes found in the code.

## Structured Expression Trees

For representing structured expression programs, MOSES uses combo tree data structures. The expressions of combo trees
are defined as follows:

```cpp
typedef tree<vertex> combo_tree;
```

A detailed description of a combo tree can be found in the c++ code.
